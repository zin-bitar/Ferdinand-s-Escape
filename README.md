This game is a maze. You spawn in a room, you need to find the exit while staying out of the line of sight of the bots.
If they see you they will chase you. You only have 3 minutes to make it to the exit.

Built with: 
- C# on VScode
- Unity

This is the backend in C#, to fully run the game you need to install your own package of bots and a maze like building.
